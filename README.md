# Recipe-Book
## Introduction
"Recipe Book" is a simple web project that I created using HTML and CSS about a year ago. It's a basic website that redirects users to three different recipes. While it's a straightforward project, it served as my introduction to web development.

## Features
Provides quick access to three different recipes.
Simple and easy-to-navigate user interface.
Built using HTML and CSS, making it a great starting point for beginners in web development.

Here's a screenshot of what the project looks like:
